COMMENTS - DO NOT COPY THIS CODE

Worked in the past, I remember having to do this weird thing to get the pages to save a certain place, but I forget.

You may need to adjust "For idx = 1 To numPages" to numPages being the actual pages, as the loop broke on me once.


Also, If you navigate to the desired output folder with the "save as" button, 
and then push cancel, it sets the desired output folder for word for this macro (I Think).

Sub SavePagesAsDoc()
    Dim orig As Document
    Dim page As Document
    Dim numPages As Integer
    Dim idx As Integer
    Dim fn As String


    ' Keep a reference to the current document.
    Set orig = ActiveDocument

    ' Calculate the number of pages
    numPages = ActiveDocument.Range.Information(wdActiveEndPageNumber)

    For idx = 1 To numPages
        ' Make sure the document is active
        orig.Activate

        ' Go to the page with index idx
        Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToPage, Name:=idx

        ' Select the current page
        Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="\page"

        ' Copy the selection
        Selection.Copy

        ' Create a new document
        Set page = Documents.Add

        ' Activate it
        page.Activate

        ' Paste the selection
        Selection.Paste

        ' Generate the file name
        fn = "Page" + CStr(idx) + ".html"


        ' Save the document as Word 97-2003
        page.SaveAs fileName:=fn, _
        FileFormat:=10


        ' Close the document
        page.Close

    Next
End Sub
